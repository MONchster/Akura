                    What stood out the most about this reading was the metaphors on what websites could be. My favourite comparision was "Website as thrown rock thatâ€™s now falling deep into the ocean". Like throwing a rock into an ocean, being unafraid to experiment and being unafraid to let go will lead to beautiful things, like a diver finding the pretty rock on the ocean's floor.
