                <summary>Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House...</summary>
                <p>
                    What stood out the most about this reading was the metaphors on what websites could be. My favourite comparision was "Website as thrown rock thatâ€™s now falling deep into the ocean". Like throwing a rock into an ocean, being unafraid to experiment and being unafraid to let go will lead to beautiful things, like a diver finding the pretty rock on the ocean's floor.

                <summary>J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</summary>
                <p>
                   "The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways."
                   I resonate with this statement J.R Carpenter makes in the article "A Handmade web" as the internet today is far different from what it used to be in the past. I noticed websites lost a sense of individuality and openness and behaves inhumane. Websites as we once knew felt more like a playground or a library, where visitors could exist as a human or a guest, instead of a customer.

                <summary>Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!</summary>
                <p>
                  This reading was refreshing to read due to it's hand-drawn imagery.
