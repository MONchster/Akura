        <p>Dreams are a <i>fascinating</i> aspect of human experience.</p>
        <p>They're mental experiences that typically occur during certain stages of sleep, characterized by a combination of images, thoughts, emotions, and sensations that often feel vivid and real. They can range from mundane to fantastical and can involve elements from our daily lives, memories, fears, desires, and imagination.</p>
        <P>Dreams serve a function in processing emotions, memories, and experiences, helping us make sense of our lives and potentially aiding in problem-solving and creativity.</p>
